As he neared the corner of  Bancroft Avenue and Phelps Street, about a half mile from his home on Goettingen Street, and he was shot by an African American man approaching him outside.  Bertuccio was shot first in his right shoulder, with the bullet passing through his chest; then, three more .32 caliber bullets were shot, each entering Bertuccio\\'s chest, and exiting through his back.  The perpetrators were two African American men, one who shot Bertuccio directly, and another who was waiting in a nearby car.
